The Long Troll

Everyone knows the old office trick of changing your buddy's desktop to something embarrassing (like Hello Kitty if it's a guy) if he leaves his workstation unlocked. Well, This is a variant on that that instead changes his _lockscreen_ background. This way, the troll goes undetected for much longer and hilarity is prolonged. Enjoy!

Also includes an undo script.

Feel free to change out the assets as desired, but be sure to look up what resolutions are supported, there are some strange restrictions (off the top of my head, must be a jpg, no larger than 245k and only certain resolutions need apply).

Usage:

Run hk.bat to copy the payload over. The .reg file activates the OEM background option (if it's not activae already)
Payload extensions are obfuscated only so that they are not obviously images (helps you not to get caught)
Similarly run undo.bat to restore the default background (useful for testing)


Limitations:

This only works on Windows 7
You must have enough access that you can modify the registry _OR_ the system must already be configured to allow OEM wallpapers
