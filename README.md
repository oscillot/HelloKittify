The Long Troll

Everyone knows the old office trick of changing your buddy's desktop to something embarrassing (like Hello Kitty if it's a guy) if he leaves his workstation unlocked. Well, This is a variant on that that instead changes his _lockscreen_ background. This way, the troll goes undetected for much longer and hilarity is prolonged. Enjoy!

Also includes an undo script.

Feel free to change out the assets as desired, but be sure to look up what resolutions are supported, there are some strange restrictions (off the top of my head, must be a jpg, no larger than 245k and only certain resolutions need apply).
